# SpringJDBC

This is a set of examples to demonstrate some Spring JDBC functionality.  It takes the Actor example in the documentation (https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/data-access.html#spring-data-tier) and further elaborates on it.  Specifically it performs CRUD and it shows different ways you can do it in Spring JDBC.  This wiki, https://wiki.martinying.com/JavaLibrariesAndFrameworks/SpringJDBC, contains the analysis of many of the different aspects.  It is not a comprehensive guide but a good start.
